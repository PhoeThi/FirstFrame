1
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,781
Damn it.

2
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,449
Again?

3
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:18,685
Let me ask you something, Richard.

4
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:19,986
You sure it's not urine

5
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:22,589
and you're not just wetting the bed?

6
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:24,658
Yeah, I'm sure. It's... it's not.

7
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:26,359
It's just sweat.

8
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:28,361
Well, then the medical
term for what you have

9
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:30,430
is "night sweats."

10
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:31,665
Okay.

11
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,567
But night sweats can be a precursor

12
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,869
to bed-wetting, and that is very serious.

13
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,604
How serious?

14
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,207
- Like, uh, cancer?
- No!

15
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:41,608
It's embarrassing.

16
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:43,643
I mean, you're a grown
man, Richard. Come on.

17
00:00:43,678 --> 00:00:45,345
That's what children do.

18
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:47,681
But I'm not wetting the bed.

19
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,650
Yet! How's your stress level been?

20
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:52,852
Uh, it's gotten worse.

21
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,955
Um, I have to get a
working beta of my platform

22
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:56,223
ready in time for January.

23
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:59,426
I just took money from
a guy who is a nightmare.

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,894
I hired six new people.

25
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:03,330
We're going to spend a ton
of money on new offices.

26
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:07,467
It's like every second, there is
a new issue that I have to solve.

27
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,803
I am stressed as hell.

28
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:12,939
Richard, currently, your
stress level is here.

29
00:01:12,974 --> 00:01:14,608
And that's night-sweats level.

30
00:01:14,642 --> 00:01:18,478
Now if you're not careful
and you let it go up,

31
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:20,080
bed-wetting.

32
00:01:28,448 --> 00:01:32,914
<b>sync and corrections
by Caio www.addic7ed.com</b>

33
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:33,693
I love these walls.

34
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:35,862
You know what it is? They're exposed brick.

35
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:38,298
Why would anyone ever hide brick?

36
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,433
Did you see the conference nook?

37
00:01:40,468 --> 00:01:42,869
Just think of the conferences
we could have in this nook.

38
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:46,406
Oh, yeah. I mean, this is really expensive.

39
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,575
So, um, what did the doctor say?

40
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:52,479
Uh, it's nothing. It's just
stress-related night sweats.

41
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:54,414
- I'll be fine.
- That's good to hear.

42
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,216
- Are you relieved?
- I would have been

43
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,318
if that idiot hadn't
have mentioned something

44
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,854
about how it can lead to, uh, bed-wetting.

45
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:03,523
I'm just trying not to think about it.

46
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:06,993
Good, don't. Definitely.

47
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:10,063
Because just thinking about it
would probably stress you out

48
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,498
- enough to make it happen...
- Stop!

49
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:12,866
Would you... Don't say "stress."

50
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,669
I just said that I was
trying not to think about it.

51
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:17,337
Well, Richard, personal management

52
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,738
is a big part of being a CEO.

53
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:20,940
You think working here might help?

54
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:24,110
Actually, uh, yeah. I think it would.

55
00:02:24,145 --> 00:02:26,212
But can we afford it?

56
00:02:26,247 --> 00:02:28,248
Well, this is an investment
in your mental health.

57
00:02:28,282 --> 00:02:31,951
Richard, I mean, can you put a
dollar value on not wetting your bed?

58
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,453
Ahh, don't.

59
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,789
If you want this, Richard,
even with the money we wasted

60
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,658
on swag and billboards, I think
I can make the numbers work.

61
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:39,959
It's your call.

62
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:42,595
Hey, guys? Um, this is Yelena.

63
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,499
She got off the elevator at the wrong floor

64
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:48,802
because her modeling agency is upstairs.

65
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,270
Richard?

66
00:02:50,304 --> 00:02:52,272
- Yeah.
- Please?

67
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,874
Primarily for other reasons,

68
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:58,411
but, uh, yes! Yeah, sure.
Uh, we're gonna take it.

69
00:02:58,446 --> 00:03:00,046
We're take... We're taking it.

70
00:03:00,081 --> 00:03:02,148
- Take? Oh.
- I'm gonna hug you.

71
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:03,616
No.

72
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,756
All right, this one's ready
to go out to the truck.

73
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,758
Great. Take it out.

74
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:15,328
Okay, you know what? I
said we should hire movers.

75
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:16,930
I don't do this kind of stuff.

76
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,798
I work with my mind, not with my hands.

77
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,800
In Pakistan, we had servants who did this.

78
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:23,803
It wasn't a big deal. We didn't pay
them very much and they were very happy.

79
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:26,106
I'll take out your box of tampons.

80
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,707
It's good for the soul.

81
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:30,443
Interesting pitch.

82
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:32,545
I will admit, I have never heard

83
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,181
a Christian-oriented
riff on dog-sharing.

84
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:38,651
But Christianity is borderline illegal

85
00:03:38,686 --> 00:03:41,888
in Northern California.
Also, how would you scale?

86
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,790
Well, we could expand

87
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,825
from sharing dogs to other types of pets...

88
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,728
- Pot-bellied pigs, ferrets...
- I'm gonna stop you right there.

89
00:03:48,763 --> 00:03:51,831
You do know that ferrets are
illegal in the state of California?

90
00:03:51,866 --> 00:03:53,733
Hmm? No.

91
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:55,535
Well, then I suppose you also don't know

92
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:59,406
that pot-bellied pigs have been
wildly unfashionable since 2005.

93
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:03,943
Owning a pot-bellied pig is frowned
upon almost as much as being a Christian.

94
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:06,579
Thank you, gentlemen. Good day.

95
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:12,752
And technically, I'm not
passing on Dog Dammit.

96
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:15,388
I'm just not saying yes.

97
00:04:15,423 --> 00:04:18,158
But who knows? The Lord
works in mysterious ways.

98
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:21,027
I don't have to tell you that.

99
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:29,936
Richard, do you have a moment?

100
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,938
I'd like to present you something.

101
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,473
Okay, what's up?

102
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,812
- What are you doing?
- Bowing.

103
00:04:38,846 --> 00:04:42,916
The Japanese have the most advanced
business culture in the world.

104
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,552
I am showing you respect
by using their traditions.

105
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:47,687
And traditionally, you give a gift

106
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:51,491
on important occasions, such
as the graduating of an incubee.

107
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,893
"Incubee"? Is that a word?

108
00:04:53,928 --> 00:04:56,262
Of course it is. One who's been incubated.

109
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,765
The inhabitant of an incubator.

110
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,467
Okay. Okay.

111
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:03,736
Now you bow. I'd really rather not.

112
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,505
Richard, I need you to bow.

113
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,277
- To the waist.
- To the waist?

114
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:14,948
Okay.

115
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,916
Now I hand this to you,

116
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:19,752
and it is customary for
you to politely refuse

117
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:22,021
and weakly say that you are not worthy.

118
00:05:22,056 --> 00:05:24,357
Erlich, I really don't have time for this.

119
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,925
That's perfect. Here you go.

120
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,160
Good.

121
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,865
Oh, wow.

122
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,367
Japanese coin. Lowest denomination.

123
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,803
Wow.

124
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,241
Is this a kimono?

125
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:44,611
- Well, try it on.
- Uh, thank you, Erlich.

126
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:51,784
<i>Sore wa meiyodeshita.</i>

127
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:54,153
According to Google Translate,

128
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,389
that means, "It has been an honor."

129
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,625
Yeah, all right.

130
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:00,126
Thank you. Thanks.

131
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,363
I'm still packing up, so
I don't want to damage it.

132
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:06,633
Eh, eh, traditionally it's rolled.

133
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:08,134
Okay.

134
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,435
Wikipedia.

135
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,406
Thanks, Erlich.

136
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,142
I'll get you something later.

137
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:20,513
<i>Oh, little kohai, you've
already given me a gift.</i>

138
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,522
Hi.

139
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:30,957
Hey.

140
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,692
Noah from next door.

141
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,295
Oh, hey. Richard.

142
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,462
Moving out?

143
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:39,232
Uh, yeah, some of us are, sort of.

144
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,501
Well, I'd be lying to say
I was sad to see you go.

145
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:44,103
Okay. Nothing personal.

146
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:46,039
You seem like nice guys,

147
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:49,008
just houses full of renters
aren't great for property values.

148
00:06:49,043 --> 00:06:50,243
Yeah, that makes sense.

149
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:53,246
This neighborhood is mostly families.

150
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,315
Okay. Well, we're moving out, so...

151
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,983
People with pets, you know?

152
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,751
Mm-hmm.

153
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:01,454
- Well, good luck.
- You too.

154
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:05,191
- What?
- You, too.

155
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:12,398
- Hey, Richard?
- Oh, hey, Jared.

156
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,500
Richard, the hosting company

157
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:17,804
that was going to be renting us
server space just dropped their bid.

158
00:07:17,838 --> 00:07:20,707
Okay, well, let's just get
servers from some other provider.

159
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:23,443
Well, I just contacted five
other web services companies,

160
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:25,411
and they're all denying us.

161
00:07:25,446 --> 00:07:29,082
I think I know what
might be happening here.

162
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:31,618
All of them...
Rackspace, Softlayer, Amazon.

163
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:34,087
I mean, they can't afford
to lose Hooli's business.

164
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:37,624
So Gavin Belson can just pick up
the phone and make us radioactive

165
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,659
to every single web-hosting service?

166
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:41,227
It's how these guys operate.

167
00:07:41,261 --> 00:07:43,563
I mean, when Bill Gates
got married on Lanai,

168
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:46,265
he rented every helicopter
on the Hawaiian islands

169
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,301
so that paparazzi couldn't
use them to fly over.

170
00:07:48,335 --> 00:07:50,203
Although in that case, it was a positive,

171
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:53,239
because now you can imagine
that wedding however you want.

172
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:54,807
- What?
- Jared?

173
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:57,010
Our entire platform is web-based.

174
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,411
We need servers for that.

175
00:07:58,445 --> 00:08:00,313
What the fuck are we going to do?

176
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:02,682
I know what the fuck we're going to do.

177
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:05,485
But you're not going to like it.

178
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,420
We build our own servers.

179
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:10,657
Gilfoyle, servers are
essentially a utility.

180
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:12,492
I mean, you wouldn't dig a well for water

181
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,460
or build a generator for power.

182
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,496
I think we should dig our own well

183
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,031
and build our own generator.

184
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,699
I also think we should
store a year's worth of food

185
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,701
and ammunition in a blast cellar.

186
00:08:21,735 --> 00:08:23,269
But we don't.

187
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,138
So good luck when the shit hits the fan.

188
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,573
Look, Richard, we're about precision,

189
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:29,676
about shaving yoctoseconds off latency

190
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,377
at every layer in the stack.

191
00:08:31,412 --> 00:08:33,980
If we rent from a public cloud,

192
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:36,115
we're using servers that are by definition

193
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,051
generic and unpredictable.

194
00:08:38,085 --> 00:08:40,553
Yeah, but we're already up
against a serious deadline.

195
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:43,756
I mean, how long is building our
own servers going to set us back?

196
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:45,158
If I busted my ass?

197
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,326
I could stand them up inside a week

198
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,262
right here in the house.

199
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:53,666
Look, Richard, truth is,

200
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:56,703
this is a huge positive.

201
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,871
I tried running the platform
on my old Bitcoin rig?

202
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:03,142
At 5200 gigaflops, your algorithm flies

203
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:06,879
800 times faster on GPUs
compared to normal CPUs.

204
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:10,083
No host could match the config
that I built here in the house.

205
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:13,453
Oh, and also, we don't
seem to have a choice.

206
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:15,755
But that would cost a ton.

207
00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:17,623
And we don't have that kind
of money just lying around.

208
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:22,295
It seems as though we do have that
kind of money just lying around.

209
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:24,063
But that's for the office space.

210
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:25,898
- Was it?
- No, no, no, no!

211
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,567
Jared, we already signed the lease.

212
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:29,936
It's too late, right?
We can't break the lease.

213
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,771
I mean, we haven't
given them the check yet.

214
00:09:31,805 --> 00:09:34,273
- Here it is.
- I could go mail it right now.

215
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:36,542
In this market, they could probably
find another tenant in a day.

216
00:09:36,577 --> 00:09:38,544
I doubt there would be an issue.

217
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,980
Fuck! Richard, please?

218
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:44,751
It's servers or offices,
Richard. We can't afford both.

219
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:47,920
Damn it, I don't know what to do.

220
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,523
Well, then it's a good thing...

221
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,892
It's a good thing that I'm here, isn't it?

222
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,162
As much as I hate to agree with Gilfoyle,

223
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,464
he's right... You have but one option.

224
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:00,767
Stay here and build the servers.

225
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,804
Are you sure? Because I've
got Carla and five other coders

226
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,906
starting over the next few weeks.

227
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,775
Well, it's going to get
a little cozy in here,

228
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:11,077
but I'll endure for your sake.

229
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:14,013
What about all your other "incubees"?

230
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:17,083
I've heard quite a few exciting
pitches over the last week,

231
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,418
but I'll be forced to
forgo those opportunities

232
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:21,687
because of your mediocrity.

233
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:25,958
You see, Richard, when I
invited you into my incubator,

234
00:10:25,993 --> 00:10:28,761
I promised to get you
ready for the outside world.

235
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:31,397
But I failed to do that. I
wouldn't trust you out there

236
00:10:31,431 --> 00:10:33,766
in the real world as
far as I could throw you.

237
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:35,601
And to be honest, I
could probably throw you

238
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,336
all the way across the front yard.

239
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:40,439
Okay, but I don't want to stay here.

240
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,308
I don't want you to either, Richard.

241
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,910
So it's agreed.

242
00:10:43,944 --> 00:10:45,311
Welcome home, fellas.

243
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:47,947
Should we smoke some pot to celebrate?

244
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:55,054
Gavin, thank you for coming.

245
00:10:55,088 --> 00:10:58,691
I am certain that once you witness
firsthand what Mr. Bighetti is up to,

246
00:10:58,725 --> 00:11:00,693
you will see that he is
worthless around here.

247
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:02,829
Worth is a relative thing.

248
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:05,932
Yes, but worthlessness
is not. It is absolute.

249
00:11:05,966 --> 00:11:09,468
People add value to this
company in many different ways.

250
00:11:09,503 --> 00:11:10,736
Of course, but look at this.

251
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:14,073
Bighetti has his team
wasting valuable resources

252
00:11:14,107 --> 00:11:16,442
- on a potato canon.
- Four, three,

253
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,578
two, one.

254
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,016
- Heads up!
- Heads!

255
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,484
Shit.

256
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,287
You see what your brightest
minds are being wasted on?

257
00:11:28,322 --> 00:11:29,488
Launching potatoes.

258
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,290
- What the fuck?
- Sorry.

259
00:11:31,325 --> 00:11:34,727
Perhaps they're developing it as
a non-lethal form of crowd control.

260
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,829
I actually think that
it could kill somebody.

261
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:38,965
But even so, compared to what my team

262
00:11:38,999 --> 00:11:41,567
has accomplished in a matter of days, I...

263
00:11:41,602 --> 00:11:43,202
Come here, I want you to meet somebody.

264
00:11:43,237 --> 00:11:45,238
All right, I've got a good
feeling about this one.

265
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:47,607
One more time. Everybody ready? Fire!

266
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,844
Oh, shit! You okay? Sorry. Shit.

267
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,647
This is Kiko.

268
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:57,183
Kiko was rescued after
a Nicaraguan landmine

269
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,584
severed both his arms.

270
00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:01,053
My team, using technology
developed at Somerville,

271
00:12:01,088 --> 00:12:02,855
was able to devise an array of sensors

272
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,824
that can non-invasively detect signals

273
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:07,727
from the neurons in the
motor cortex in the brain.

274
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:12,231
So without surgery, we
have given Kiko the gift

275
00:12:12,266 --> 00:12:14,033
of a usable prosthetic appendage.

276
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,437
What's he doing?

277
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:23,910
What Kiko chooses to do with
the technology is not important.

278
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:26,145
What's important here is that,

279
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:28,748
in spite of what it may
seem like on the surface,

280
00:12:28,782 --> 00:12:32,385
building a device that is capable of this

281
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:34,987
is a remarkable scientific achievement.

282
00:12:35,022 --> 00:12:37,323
And what you're looking
at is really a testament

283
00:12:37,357 --> 00:12:39,025
to my team and to my leadership,

284
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:41,727
and I just... I feel that...

285
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:48,100
I'm going to have to insist that
Bighetti be removed if I continue here.

286
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:50,536
Davis, there are a lot
of forces at work here.

287
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,672
There's a lot at play
that you are not privy to.

288
00:12:52,706 --> 00:12:55,708
Please do not question how
I choose to run my company.

289
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,210
Of course, I just have to
think that both of our interests

290
00:12:58,245 --> 00:13:01,213
would be better served if Bighettwas not...

291
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,381
What is he doing now?

292
00:13:04,518 --> 00:13:06,285
Oh, God.

293
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,387
Again, I have to stress
that what the monkey chooses

294
00:13:08,422 --> 00:13:10,289
to do with the technology
is not necessarily

295
00:13:10,324 --> 00:13:11,757
an indictment of the technology itself.

296
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,693
Gavin, please!

297
00:13:13,727 --> 00:13:15,895
Oh!

298
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:22,034
Okay. So I'll put 80 GPUs
on racks against that wall.

299
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:24,437
We'll have three main
cabinets in the center.

300
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,639
I'll try and pull 220-volt power

301
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,674
from the washer/dryer
for all the cooling units.

302
00:13:28,709 --> 00:13:30,843
So you'll need this entire space then?

303
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:32,511
Yep. All right.

304
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:35,514
- I'll move my things.
- What?

305
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:38,517
It's okay, I travel light. I'll
have it all in my car in no time.

306
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:41,220
Wait, Jared, uh...

307
00:13:41,254 --> 00:13:43,956
are you living here in the garage?

308
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,625
Indeed I am. High on the hog.

309
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,397
Jesus Christ, poor fucker.
Sleeping out there with the rodents.

310
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:54,667
Hey, I keep a clean garage.
There are no rodents out there.

311
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:57,069
How can you guarantee there
are no rodents living there

312
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:58,938
when you didn't even know
Jared was living there?

313
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:01,440
I need all rodents and
Jareds out of the garage.

314
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:02,541
I need the space.

315
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:04,243
Do we have any extra power strips?

316
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,911
There's not a lot of outlets out there.

317
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:09,782
There are a lot of dudes
playing foosball, loudly.

318
00:14:09,816 --> 00:14:12,218
I'll take care of that.
Say no more. Jian-Yang!

319
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,854
I need all of your guys out of there,

320
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,422
and the foosball table.

321
00:14:16,456 --> 00:14:18,524
Those not my guys.

322
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:21,293
They're always around. Who are they?

323
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,063
Friends of friends.

324
00:14:24,097 --> 00:14:28,034
They're friends of your... Mother fuck!

325
00:14:29,302 --> 00:14:32,772
Guys, look, Jared gave up his own apartment

326
00:14:32,806 --> 00:14:36,142
so he could take less salary
and save the company money.

327
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:40,012
I mean, Erlich, can he just stay here?

328
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:43,015
Once again, because of
your poor managerial skills,

329
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,518
I've been hoisted upon my own petard.

330
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,420
Yes, he can stay here.

331
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:49,789
Great. So, um, which room can he stay in?

332
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:52,324
Well, he's not staying in mine.

333
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,293
I sleep dick-up.

334
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,164
Okay, so then...

335
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,965
Uh, not it.

336
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,834
Okay.

337
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,971
- Not a chance in hell.
- All right. Ahem.

338
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:07,907
Fuck.

339
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:33,299
Oh, shit.

340
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:36,001
'Morning, roomie. I made you a half-caff.

341
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:37,603
Oh.

342
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:39,805
- Richard.
- Yeah.

343
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,074
I, um, I sweated through my sheets again.

344
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:43,943
You sweated? You sure you didn't...

345
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,679
Yes, I'm sure. It's just sweat, so...

346
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:49,949
Do you think maybe you
sweat from your urethra?

347
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,784
No, I didn't sweat through my...

348
00:15:51,818 --> 00:15:53,385
You know what? Let's not talk about it.

349
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,754
Because talking about it
will only exacerbate...

350
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:58,424
- Stop.
- Yeah.

351
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:02,328
Hey, um, when did you
learn to speak German?

352
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,430
What? I don't speak German.

353
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,099
- You sure?
- Yeah.

354
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,471
All this hardware for $70,000?

355
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:14,406
- Yup.
- It's nice work.

356
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:16,041
Oh, look at all this stuff.

357
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:19,178
Oh, is that a Radeon
7850? We're usinthese, huh?

358
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,412
There's no "we."

359
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:21,847
You don't do this kind of work, remember?

360
00:16:21,882 --> 00:16:24,049
You make a living with
your mind, not your hands.

361
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:26,085
- No, no, no...
- So don't touch.

362
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,087
You misunderstood me. I like hardware.

363
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,222
I made my own computer when I was nine.

364
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:32,224
From scratch or kit?

365
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,693
It was from a kit, but I did my own mods.

366
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,762
- That's what I thought.
- I was nine.

367
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:39,598
I'm sure you were great at
fingerpainting, also, Dinesh.

368
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:42,401
Richard is the CEO. He
delegated this to me.

369
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,270
Why don't you go inside and
write some princess code?

370
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:46,739
Leave the hardware up to us servants.

371
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:48,974
All right, I got the
crimper and some heat shrink.

372
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:51,777
- Great.
- Wait, she can help but not me?

373
00:16:51,811 --> 00:16:53,345
That's right.

374
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,481
Can I help? Please?

375
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,851
Mmm, no.

376
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,653
I said... Richard, you
have to let me help him.

377
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,322
Dinesh, you have to hack away on
the front end of the build anyway.

378
00:17:03,356 --> 00:17:05,724
- So why don't you...
- Excuse me?

379
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,626
- Excuse me?
- Oh, this is bullshit.

380
00:17:07,661 --> 00:17:10,329
- Oh, hey, Noah.
- I thought you guy were moving up?

381
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,198
But it looks like you're moving back in.

382
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,200
Well, yeah, it's a
little complicated, but...

383
00:17:14,234 --> 00:17:16,202
What are you guys doing in there?

384
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,737
What, you building some kind of computer?

385
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:22,975
Well, more of a server/data center.

386
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:26,412
It's actually pretty interesting,
if you're into that sort of stuff.

387
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:27,846
Hello?

388
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:29,582
Stop talking immediately!

389
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:32,384
Come inside. Don't look
at me. Don't look at me!

390
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:33,719
Don't look at me.

391
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:37,056
Just tell him that you shit
your pants and have weak knees.

392
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,958
What were you doing out there?

393
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:41,927
- Oh, um...
- Why were you talking to that person?

394
00:17:41,962 --> 00:17:44,396
'Cause he lives next door.
I was just being neighborly.

395
00:17:44,431 --> 00:17:46,432
Neighborly? First of
all, that's not a word.

396
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,701
Second of all, you don't
talk to the neighbors, ever.

397
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,369
In fact, don't talk to anybody.

398
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,171
It's no one's business what we do here.

399
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:54,340
Why would anyone care what goes on in here?

400
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:57,142
'Cause we're not zoned
for business, obviously.

401
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,111
What... what do you mean
we're not zoned for business?

402
00:17:59,145 --> 00:18:02,348
I just moved my entire business here!

403
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,416
You just keep your mouth shut
and everything will be fine.

404
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,285
You talked me into staying
here even though you knew

405
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,886
we were breaking the law?

406
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,756
I'm sorry, Erlich, but I'm pissed.

407
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:12,825
- You're pissed at me?
- Yeah.

408
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:14,460
I should be pissed at you.

409
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:15,961
- You know why?
- Why?

410
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:17,596
Because when one is given a parting gift

411
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:20,499
and one never parts, shouldn't
one return the said gift?

412
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,268
Isn't that what decorum would dictate?

413
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:23,802
Oh, this is out the kimono?

414
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:27,373
Okay, I will give it back
to you right now, gladly.

415
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:28,774
Now I'm really pissed.

416
00:18:28,808 --> 00:18:31,677
Because if one appreciated
a gift of such magnitude,

417
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:33,312
then one would put up more of a fight

418
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,314
before returning it, wouldn't one?

419
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:38,484
Okay, okay.

420
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,452
A complaint from the neighbor

421
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:43,022
to the Department of Planning
and Community Environment

422
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,357
triggers an inspection,
which can lead to a citation,

423
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:49,228
fines, or even the seizure and
impounding of our equipment.

424
00:18:49,262 --> 00:18:53,032
That gentleman next door
has the power to ruin us.

425
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,466
Jesus.

426
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:57,770
Richard, can I suggest you
take it easy on the Red Bulls?

427
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:01,206
It's a diuretic, and given your issue...

428
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:03,075
My issue?

429
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:06,779
Oh, God. It's night sweats, Jared.

430
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,915
Yes, well, regardless of what
we've decided on calling it,

431
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:13,018
pounding caffeine and sugar
is not exactly going to help.

432
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:15,754
But you know what might? Kegels.

433
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:16,889
What?

434
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:20,693
Kegels are a form of exercise
that strengthen the pelvic floor.

435
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:23,829
Yes, it's most commonly used
by women to recover control

436
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,831
of their vaginal muscles after childbirth,

437
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:27,733
but it can really help,

438
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,469
you know, "night sweats."

439
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:31,970
Wow.

440
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,740
Okay, we're not going to
talk about this anymore.

441
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:36,141
I'm doing it right now.

442
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:39,345
Clench, unclench, clench...

443
00:19:39,379 --> 00:19:41,013
Stop.

444
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,514
You hear that?

445
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:45,617
Hey, hey.

446
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,486
Stop it, hey. Turn the music down.

447
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,121
Turn it... turn it off. We have neighbors.

448
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:51,090
Are you kidding me? Look, Gilfoyle,

449
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:54,026
you said that you would have
all the servers up and running.

450
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,161
And we're already a week behind.

451
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,963
Don't you think you should
be doing that instead of,

452
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,264
you know, getting high on the job?

453
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,200
I'm not getting high on the job.

454
00:20:01,234 --> 00:20:03,035
I'm getting high at home.

455
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,037
I live here, remember?

456
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:07,172
Right, okay, fair enough. Fair enough.

457
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:08,941
But Carla doesn't. These guys don't.

458
00:20:08,975 --> 00:20:13,011
I'm having them over as guests, at my home.

459
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,347
If that's okay with you, Richard.

460
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,149
This is your home.

461
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:19,351
- Yes.
- You live in the workplace.

462
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,086
But you also work from home.

463
00:20:21,121 --> 00:20:23,188
That must be really confusing for you.

464
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,758
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.

465
00:20:25,792 --> 00:20:28,594
That's kind of the...

466
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:35,167
Does it look dark to you guys?

467
00:20:39,873 --> 00:20:41,940
Oh, hey, guys.

468
00:20:41,975 --> 00:20:43,108
Dude, what the fuck?

469
00:20:43,143 --> 00:20:44,810
The power's out.

470
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:49,214
Okay, fine, I wanted to set up one GPU,

471
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,084
just one, and so I turned the power on

472
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:54,219
and the whole system lit up. And...

473
00:20:54,254 --> 00:20:55,854
Yeah, it did, you dick.

474
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:57,289
'Cause I bypassed the meter to save money

475
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:59,691
and went directly to the
feed without the UPS ready.

476
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:03,328
That surge just fragged
the whole fucking system.

477
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,301
Holy shit.

478
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:10,836
What the hell did you guys do?

479
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,672
The power in the whole block is down.

480
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:14,840
Great.

481
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,809
What the...

482
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:19,344
Oh, God, look who it is.

483
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,847
We need to talk, guys.

484
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:23,849
Hold on a sec.

485
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,285
No, whatever you're going to
say, just say it from there.

486
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,753
We can hear you.

487
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,888
If you didn't have so
many cars parked here,

488
00:21:29,923 --> 00:21:31,256
maybe I could get through.

489
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,592
He's really going to go all the way around?

490
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:36,495
- That's a long ways.
- Hold on.

491
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,631
Jesus Christ! Save some
battery, for Christ's sake!

492
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:41,934
- Just a sec.
- Just yell it!

493
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:44,303
It's okay, Noah, we get it.
You can say it from there.

494
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:46,705
You're gonna report us to
the city inspector, right?

495
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:48,841
Jesus!

496
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,275
Guess what?

497
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,377
I'm reporting you to the city inspector.

498
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:53,745
Right.

499
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:58,150
Zoning codes are very clear.

500
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:05,090
Neighborhood's for families, pets.

501
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:10,362
<i>Nicht verstehen!</i>

502
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:17,369
Holy shit.

503
00:22:30,984 --> 00:22:33,919
Come here, Agamemnon. Come here, boy.

504
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:36,688
Yes. Who's a good boy?

505
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:38,924
Yeah, you're a good boy.

506
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:41,360
Come here, Agamemnon.

507
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:44,563
Did that blackout scare you, Agamemnon?

508
00:22:44,597 --> 00:22:46,999
Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy.

509
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:50,202
Yeah. Give me a kiss. Mwah!

510
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,204
- Oh, yeah.
- Holy shit.

511
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:55,274
Oh, yeah. Daddy loves you, Daddy loves you.

512
00:22:55,308 --> 00:22:57,142
Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss. Oh, yeah.

513
00:22:57,176 --> 00:23:00,312
Erlich?

514
00:23:00,346 --> 00:23:02,281
- What is it?
- Hey.

515
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:04,483
Um, I'm sorry I didn't
give you back the kimono

516
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:06,952
or resist giving you back the
kimono, or whatever it was,

517
00:23:06,986 --> 00:23:10,355
but I have a gift that
might make it up to you.

518
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,692
Is that what I think it is?

519
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,661
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, boy.

520
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,669
It is 4:00 in the morning! What the...

521
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:26,238
Why are you both wearing kimonos?

522
00:23:26,272 --> 00:23:30,809
Noah, are you familiar with the
California Fish and Game Code,

523
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:33,745
section 2116-2126,

524
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,449
with regard to the possession
and harboring of ferrets?

525
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:40,752
- Oh, God.
- Oh, yeah.

526
00:23:40,787 --> 00:23:43,021
Those little shits are illegal.

527
00:23:43,056 --> 00:23:45,624
Erlich, please, don't.
I'll... I'll do anything.

528
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,459
Oh, yeah, you will.

529
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,795
We are here to stay,
and you're going to keep

530
00:23:49,829 --> 00:23:52,998
that bearded little hole in the
center of your face shut about it.

531
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,300
- Listen, I was just trying...
- No, you listen.

532
00:23:55,335 --> 00:23:57,936
You're always going on and on about
how this is such a good neighborhood.

533
00:23:57,971 --> 00:24:00,038
Do you know why it's
such a good neighborhood?

534
00:24:00,073 --> 00:24:02,040
Do you know why your shitty house

535
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:04,009
is worth 20 times what you
paid for it in the 1970s?

536
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,378
Cause of people like us moving in

537
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:08,547
and starting illegal
businesses in our garages.

538
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:11,249
All the best companies... Apple, Google,

539
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:12,951
Hewlett-Packard, even Aviato,

540
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:16,221
all of them were started
in unzoned garages.

541
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:17,723
That is why Silicon Valley

542
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:20,559
is one of the hottest
neighborhoods in the world.

543
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:22,060
Because of people like us,

544
00:24:22,095 --> 00:24:24,062
not because of people like you.

545
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:28,400
So if I catch even so
much as a dirty glance

546
00:24:28,434 --> 00:24:30,569
or a lascivious look
in Richard's direction,

547
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:32,404
that is it.

548
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:34,373
Those weasels are dog food.

549
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:35,774
Okay. Okay.

550
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,409
Um, guest house.

551
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:40,612
Yes. Is your guest house
currently rented out?

552
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,114
No, it's not for rent.

553
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,182
Well, it mother-fucking is now.

554
00:24:44,217 --> 00:24:45,684
Your new tenant is Jared Dunn.

555
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:48,353
His rent will be exceedingly reasonable.

556
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:50,756
And his utilities will be included.

557
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:53,759
He speaks German in the night.

558
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:57,529
Well, if you'll excuse us, we
have an illegal business to run.

559
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:58,797
Erlich?

560
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:06,905
But when our scientists did the study,

561
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:09,074
they found the rate of birth
defects in that territory

562
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:12,344
was actually higher before we
opened our battery plant there.

563
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:14,813
But, very good question.
Thank you for that question.

564
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:18,984
Okay, before I finish up
here, I have an announcement.

565
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,253
Today I have accepted the resignation

566
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:22,754
of Dr. Davis Bannerchek.

567
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:24,523
So it pleases me to inform you all

568
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:25,824
that effective immediately,

569
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:28,760
Nelson Bighetti has been
promoted to sole head dreamer

570
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:31,296
of Hooli XYZ.

571
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,698
Sorry, what?

572
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,232
Stand up, Bag Head.

573
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:36,468
What a meteoric ascension.

574
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:39,137
Just a few months ago,
you co-founded Pied Piper

575
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:40,806
and now you've been promoted twice.

576
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,340
It speaks to your competence.

577
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:44,910
Give it up for Bag Head,
ladies and gentlemen.

578
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:51,416
And lastly, I have big news.

579
00:25:51,451 --> 00:25:56,354
In anticipation of our big release
of Nucleus at CES in January,

580
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:59,091
we've decided to give
the world a sneak preview.

581
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,293
Nucleus, in partnership with Dana White

582
00:26:01,327 --> 00:26:02,794
and the Ultimate Fighting Championship

583
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:05,731
will be the exclusive
provider of live streaming

584
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:08,300
for next month's Ultimate
Fighting Championship event,

585
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:10,569
Molina versus Bulgakov II.

586
00:26:10,603 --> 00:26:14,072
I realize the full platform
won't be ready until January,

587
00:26:14,107 --> 00:26:15,941
but our Nucleus division assures me

588
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:17,642
they are ready for this challenge.

589
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:19,945
And I can think of no more exciting a way

590
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:22,748
to give a little taste of
Nucleus to the entire world

591
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:26,518
than by putting video latency
in a rear-naked choke hold.

592
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:29,755
Great job, team. All right, back to work.

593
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,793
Did you, uh, tell Gavin

594
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:37,162
where we are on the video situation?

595
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:39,297
He does know thatonverting
the whole platform

596
00:26:39,332 --> 00:26:42,100
to middle-out has put us at least
six weeks behind schedule, right?

597
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:44,536
Well, I'm not going to
be the one who tells him

598
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,939
we're that far behind.
If you want to, feel free.

599
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,378
I just heard you tell
Heidi we'rsix weeks behind?

600
00:26:53,412 --> 00:26:56,148
But remember that drop-frame
issue I showed you?

601
00:26:56,215 --> 00:26:58,150
We're easily 15 weeks behind.

602
00:26:58,184 --> 00:27:01,453
Well, I'm not going to be the
one to tell Heidi about that.

603
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:04,856
Feel free to tell her yourself.

604
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,594
Did I just hear you say
we're only 15 weeks behind?

605
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,930
I've been integrating
the system natively...

606
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:14,332
Dude, I don't even want to know about it.

607
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:18,974
